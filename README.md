# Avalanche
Stack-based (no registers) VM. Written in Rust "just for fun"
## Introduction
VM has "infinity" 32-bit stack, but **has no registers**. All instructions (excluding *test*) focused on working with stack
### Instructions
*Spaces and line breaks are ignored*  
push **num** - push 32-bit number on stack  
pop - remove 32-bit number from stack  
test - print "Hello, World!" message  
add - add two numbers on stack. Result will be at the top of the stack (*Removes input numbers*)  
printn - display number at top of stack (*Removes input number*)  
rcv - take number and put it on top of stack  
recv - take char and put it on top of stack  
prints - display char at top of stack (*Removes input number*)
call - jump to address at top of stack (*Replaces input address with self address*)
